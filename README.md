# travelRush2

travelRush2 is designed to assist rushed travelers with unplanned last-minute trips, by providing a quick one stop search for airports, destination weather forecast, and nearby hotels and restaurants.

## Overview

travelRush2 accepts user inputs- destination address and departure date, and queries different APIs to display pertinent information about the desination. The full stack app, which is built on the MERN stack, allows the user to register for an account and save favorite searches for future retrieval.

## Instructions

### [Demo]()

1. Use the 'Search By' drop down to select how you would like to enter your destination (address or airport)
2. Select a 'Departure Date(_within the next 5 days_) by clcking in the calendar field
3. Hit Submit
4. Review the initial results and click on the circle icons in each result card to view additional result details.
5. In order to access your account to track items like favorites and past searches, click the Login button. If you don't have an account click 'Sign Up' and register for an account on travelRush.

A future goal is to add features to the app, such as allowing users to choose departure dates within the next 16 days, including autocomplete capabilities so that users can choose an airport or city and state name as their destination, and displaying real-time discounted flight options.
